Secret Mission
Farmer John is being sent on a secret mission with one of his cows. However, Farmer John has not been told which cow to bring; instead, he is given a code with the following rules: The name of the cow (in uppercase letters) and the code should be transformed into a number, which is the product of all the letters in the string mod 47, where “A” is 1 and “Z” is 26. For example, BESSIE’s number would be (2 * 5 * 19 * 19 * 9 * 5) % 47 = 18. The cow will accompany Farmer John on the mission if the cow’s number equals the code’s number. Given the name of a cow and a code, determine if the cow should accompany Farmer John on the mission, printing “GO” if the numbers are equal or “STAY” if they aren’t.
