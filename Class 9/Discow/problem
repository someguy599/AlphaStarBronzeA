Discow
[ Memory: 16 MB, CPU: 1 sec ]

The cows in Farmer John’s farm have developed a new game called Discow. In Discow, 26 pairs of cows, labeled A through Z, stand in a circle and throw a frisbee in a straight line back and forth to each other, with the two cows labelled A passing to each other, the two cows labeled B passing to each other, and so and so forth. However, sometimes, two frisbees can collide when being thrown, which only happens if the paths of the two frisbees intersect. Given an arrangement of cows, determine how many pairs of frisbees could collide when thrown.

INPUT FORMAT

A single string with 52 upper-case characters, with each letter A…Z showing up twice, listing the cows in the circle in clockwise order.
